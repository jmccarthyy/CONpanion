This is the official GitHub repository for my final year project: CONpanion!

CONpanion (short for Conditioning Companion) is a gym-focused companion application developed for iOS using XCode and Swift. This project will focus specifically on creating a prototype companion app tailored specifically for people who go to the gym and train using weights, who also want to stay on top of their nutrition as well as track their progress live. This will be done through a ‘live workout’ feature which, when activated, will act as if a personal trainer was in the gym with the user. The app would, based on the user’s previous workouts and routines, tell the user what to do to improve in the gym and make progress, how long to rest for, suggest new workouts and more. There will also be a feature so they can record other types of exercise they do, which will not make use of the ‘live workout’ feature but will calculate how many calories they burned doing this exercise, which will affect their nutrition needs accordingly. As well as this, daily weight (measured externally by the user) and progress pictures can be recorded within the app which contribute to the user’s nutrition goals depending on the fitness goals they are trying to achieve.
